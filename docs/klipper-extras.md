# Experimental Klipper CNC Extras

This repository includes optional Klipper modules:

- `work_coordinate_systems.py` adds persistent G54-G59 work coordinates,
  G53 machine mode, and G10 L2/L20.
- `touch_probe.py` adds guarded XY stylus probing for edges, centers, and
  bores, plus reference Z surface probing.
- `tool_setter.py` uses a fixed machine-mounted tool setter to re-touch Z after
  manual tool changes.

The WCS and XY probe modules were originally developed by **Shadowphyre from
the E3CNC Discord community** and shared for beta testing. Klipper Screen CNC
hardens and extends them for this fork. The cutting-tool Z workflow is a
separate module derived from the same endstop-probing approach.

!!! warning

    These modules can move a CNC machine outside ordinary G-code execution.
    Test every direction with the spindle off, low speeds, generous clearance,
    and immediate access to an emergency stop.

## Install

Copy the modules into the active Klipper source tree:

```sh
cp klipper-extras/work_coordinate_systems.py ~/klipper/klippy/extras/
cp klipper-extras/touch_probe.py ~/klipper/klippy/extras/
cp klipper-extras/tool_setter.py ~/klipper/klippy/extras/
```

On installations where Klipper lives elsewhere, copy them into that
installation's `klippy/extras/` directory. Restart Klipper after adding or
updating either file.

`touch-ui/scripts/KlipperScreen-update.sh` also tries to copy these modules automatically.
It checks `~/klipper/klippy/extras/`, `~/Klipper/klippy/extras/`,
`~/printer_data/klipper/klippy/extras/`, and common `/home/*/klipper` paths.

For nonstandard installations, set one of these environment variables in the
Moonraker update-manager environment:

```sh
KLIPPER_PATH=/path/to/klipper
KLIPPER_EXTRAS_PATH=/path/to/klippy/extras
```

Set `INSTALL_KLIPPER_EXTRAS=0` to opt out. If the script cannot find the active
Klipper extras directory, it logs the paths it tried and the modules must be
copied manually.

## Work Coordinate Systems

Add:

```ini
[work_coordinate_systems]
persist_file: ~/printer_data/config/wcs_offsets.json
```

The module intentionally waits until XYZ are homed before applying the saved
WCS. This prevents stale offsets from altering the unhomed coordinate state
after a restart. Selecting G54-G59 is persisted automatically, even before
homing; the selected WCS is applied after the next full XYZ home.

Available commands:

```gcode
G54
G55
G53
G10 L2 P1 X10 Y20 Z30
G10 L20 P1 X0 Y0 Z0
WCS_STATUS
SAVE_WCS
```

`G53` remains modal in this experimental implementation. Select G54-G59 again
after machine-coordinate work. The bundled cancel/end macros already restore
the active WCS after parking.

## XY Stylus Probe

This probe is mounted in the ER11 collet and locates workpiece geometry.
Replacing it with a cutting tool does not invalidate XY because both tools
share the spindle centerline. Its Z result is a reference surface for setup
and tool-setter calibration; use the fixed tool setter after changing to a
cutting bit.

Example configuration:

```ini
[touch_probe]
pin: ^!PC5
surface_result_file: ~/printer_data/config/touch_probe_surface.json
travel_speed: 40
fast_speed: 10
slow_speed: 1
max_distance: 50
retract_distance: 2
tip_diameter: 4.97
trigger_offset: 0
z_hop: 10
z_hop_speed: 10
overshoot: 10
samples: 1
spindle_object: output_pin spindle
```

The plugin rejects probing while a virtual-SD job is printing or paused, while
the configured spindle output is nonzero, when required axes are unhomed, or
when the probe is already triggered. A hop-over command also aborts if the full
requested Z clearance is unavailable within machine limits.

For a normally-closed touch probe, configure the pin inversion so a disconnected
probe, broken wire, or touched probe reports `TRIGGERED`. When connected and
untouched, `QUERY_TOUCH_PROBE` should report `ready`. In this documentation,
`ready` means the configured Klipper input is not triggered; it does not mean
the electrical circuit is physically open.

Raw and diagnostic commands:

```gcode
QUERY_TOUCH_PROBE
PROBE_X_POS
PROBE_X_NEG
PROBE_Y_POS
PROBE_Y_NEG
PROBE_Z_NEG
```

Workpiece commands:

```gcode
FIND_EDGE_X_POS
FIND_EDGE_X_NEG
FIND_EDGE_Y_POS
FIND_EDGE_Y_NEG
FIND_SURFACE_Z
FIND_CENTER_X DISTANCE=40
FIND_CENTER_Y DISTANCE=30
FIND_CENTER_XY DISTANCE_X=40 DISTANCE_Y=30
PROBE_BORE
```

Add `SET_ZERO=1` to a workpiece command to update the currently selected
G54-G59 coordinate directly:

```gcode
FIND_EDGE_X_NEG SET_ZERO=1
FIND_SURFACE_Z SET_ZERO=1
FIND_CENTER_XY DISTANCE_X=40 DISTANCE_Y=30 SET_ZERO=1
```

`FIND_EDGE_X_NEG` and `FIND_EDGE_Y_NEG` move toward the machine-negative side.
`FIND_EDGE_X_POS` and `FIND_EDGE_Y_POS` move toward the machine-positive side.
The bundled `FIND_STOCK_*_MIN/MAX` macro wrappers assume the probe starts
outside the target stock edge and moves inward until it touches the stock:
X-min moves X+, X-max moves X-, Y-min moves Y+, and Y-max moves Y-.

This does not use `G92`. The probe result is captured in machine coordinates,
then converted into a persistent WCS offset even though the tool has already
retracted from the contact surface.

Surface tilt measuring:

```gcode
MEASURE_SURFACE_TILT COORD=MACHINE PATTERN=CORNERS_4
MEASURE_SURFACE_TILT COORD=WCS WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=80 PATTERN=CROSS_5
MEASURE_SURFACE_TILT COORD=WCS X_MIN=0 X_MAX=100 Y_MIN=0 Y_MAX=80
```

The latest surface map is exposed through the `touch_probe` status object and
persisted to `surface_result_file` so Klipper Screen CNC can redraw the most
recent map after a refresh or restart. This is report-only; it does not enable
automatic Z compensation.

## Calibration

`trigger_offset` is the empirical XY overtravel correction used together
with half the probe-tip diameter. It must be zero or positive.

Probe parameters such as `TRAVEL_SPEED`, `FAST_SPEED`, `SLOW_SPEED`,
`MAX_DISTANCE`, `RETRACT_DISTANCE`, `SAMPLES`, `Z_HOP`, `Z_HOP_SPEED`, and
`OVERSHOOT` may be overridden per command. `TRAVEL_SPEED` controls non-contact
XY repositioning between probe points; `FAST_SPEED` and `SLOW_SPEED` control
the probing moves toward the contact.

## Fixed Tool Setter

Configure this module when a switch or touch plate is permanently mounted on
the machine bed:

```ini
[tool_setter]
pin: ^!PC6
persist_file: ~/printer_data/config/tool_setter.json
setter_x: 186.5
setter_y: 246.5
safe_z: 60
travel_speed: 30
z_speed: 10
fast_speed: 5
slow_speed: 0.5
max_distance: 25
retract_distance: 2
final_retract: 5
trigger_offset: 0
samples: 1
spindle_object: output_pin spindle
```

The fixed setter can use a different input pin from the XY touch probe. It is
intended for manual setup and UI buttons, not automatic mid-job tool changes.
`setter_x`, `setter_y`, and `safe_z` are machine coordinates. They are not
affected by the active G54-G59 WCS, and the module does not switch into `G53`
or leave the controller in machine-coordinate mode.

Typical setup:

1. Home XYZ, select the intended G54-G59 WCS, and use the XY/Z probing workflow
   to set the stock work zero.
2. With the same reference probe still installed, run:

   ```gcode
   CALIBRATE_SETTER_Z
   ```

   This measures the fixed setter after stock Z0 is set. It moves to the
   configured machine-space `setter_x`/`setter_y`, probes down, and stores the
   fixed setter's Z height in the active WCS.

3. Replace the probe with the cutting bit.
4. Probe the bit against the fixed setter:

   ```gcode
   SET_BIT_Z
   ```

   By default this only reports the calculated WCS Z adjustment.

5. Apply the adjustment after verifying the result:

   ```gcode
   SET_BIT_Z APPLY=1
   ```

   `SET_ZERO=1` is accepted as an alias for UI consistency.

Available commands:

```gcode
QUERY_TOOL_SETTER
TOOL_SETTER_ACCURACY
CALIBRATE_SETTER_Z
SET_BIT_Z
```

Useful command overrides:

```gcode
TOOL_SETTER_ACCURACY SAMPLES=10
CALIBRATE_SETTER_Z X=186.5 Y=246.5 SAFE_Z=60
SET_BIT_Z SAMPLES=3 APPLY=1
```

The `X`, `Y`, and `SAFE_Z` overrides are also machine coordinates.

Command purpose:

- `QUERY_TOOL_SETTER`: report whether the setter input is ready or triggered,
  plus the saved calibration state.
- `TOOL_SETTER_ACCURACY`: repeatedly probe the fixed setter and report
  min/max/range/average/median/standard deviation. It does not change WCS or
  calibration.
- `CALIBRATE_SETTER_Z`: after stock Z0 has been set with the reference probe,
  measure where the fixed setter is relative to the active WCS.
- `SET_BIT_Z`: after changing to a cutting bit, measure the bit on the fixed
  setter and optionally update active WCS Z with `APPLY=1`.

The module requires homed XYZ, spindle off, no active print, and a ready setter
input before probing. For a normally-closed setter switch, configure the pin so
an unplugged switch or broken wire reports `TRIGGERED`; `QUERY_TOOL_SETTER`
should report `ready` only when the switch is connected and untouched.
`CALIBRATE_SETTER_Z` and `SET_BIT_Z` also require a
selected G54-G59 WCS. It travels in machine coordinates, lifts to `SAFE_Z`,
moves to the fixed setter XY, probes downward, and leaves Z retracted. The
active WCS is preserved for all travel moves; only `SET_BIT_Z APPLY=1` changes
the active WCS Z offset.
